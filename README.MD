# autoUTF8

Refuse messy encoding, UTF-8 is the mainstream.

Some chip companies do not standardize coding, use this script to standardize.

The NG Version is in branch, the NG version can display the encoding results graphically
## How to use

```shell
python3 autoUTF8.py path
```
The output file is in the out folder.

If you only want to view the file encoding without converting, set DO_ENCODE in the autoUTF8,py to False
