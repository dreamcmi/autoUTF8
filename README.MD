# autoUTF8 NG

## The ng version supports the output of rectangular charts to display the results

Refuse messy encoding, UTF-8 is the mainstream.

Some chip companies do not standardize coding, use this script to standardize.

## How to use

```shell
python3 autoUTF8.py -p path -n name
```
The output file is in the out folder.

If you only want to view the file encoding without converting, set `DO_ENCODE` in the `autoUTF8,py`  to `False`
